Noto Overview
=============

[Go here](https://notofonts.github.io/overview)

This is an overview of the Noto project's Unicode coverage. It allows you to see which codepoints are included and which Noto fonts contain them; more to the point, it allows you to see areas where there are allocated Unicode codepoints which are not yet supported by Noto.

(Note that in some of the CJK blocks, codepoints may be unsupported by Noto fonts simply because we can't actually fit any more glyphs into those fonts.)

Suggestions for improvement are welcome - please add to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/notofonts/overview/issues).
